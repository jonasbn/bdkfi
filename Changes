Release 0.04, 2011.12.03

- Bug fix release re-addressing previous attempts at fixing bug (see 0.03). The issue seemed to be one of 
  architecture and where I have only developed on 64-bit enabled platforms using 64-bit enabled perl I could
  not replicate the issue, which was related to Perl's sprintf on 32-bit perl. I now use string indications (s)
  instead of signed integer (d) and it seems to work.

- Attempt at addressing failing tests, reported by CPAN testers. I have not been

  addressing the same problem [BDK-17]
