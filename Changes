0.04 2011-12-03

- Bug fix release, update recommended for users of 32-bit perl

- Bug fix release re-addressing previous attempts at fixing bug (see 0.03). The issue seemed 
  to be one of architecture and where I have only developed on 64-bit enabled platforms using 
  64-bit enabled perl I could not replicate the issue, which was related to Perl's sprintf on 
  32-bit perl. I now use string indications (s) instead of signed integer (d) and it seems to 
  work.
